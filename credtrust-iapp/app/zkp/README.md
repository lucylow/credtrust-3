# ZKP Assets (precompiled)

Place your precompiled circuits here:
- `credtrust-v2.wasm`
- `credtrust-v2.zkey`

These files are required by `credtrust.js` during proving. Do not commit private keys or toxic waste. If you need to fetch them at build-time, adjust the Dockerfile to `curl` them from a secure bucket.
